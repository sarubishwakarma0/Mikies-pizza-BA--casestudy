    # Mikie’s Pizza & Sub – POS Modernization & Business Strategy Case Study

**Role:** Business Analyst / Store Manager  
**Domain:** Food Service & Operations  
**Tools Used:** Slice POS, Cost Analysis, Vendor Comparison, Menu Strategy  

## Overview
This case study highlights how I improved operational efficiency and developed a revenue-boosting lunch strategy at Mikie’s Pizza & Sub. We previously managed orders through multiple platforms and devices, leading to confusion, higher costs, and missed sales opportunities. I led the transition to a modern POS system and designed a new lunch strategy tailored to our downtown customer base.
## Problem
- Separate printers for UberEats, DoorDash, Grubhub = confusion + slow order flow  
- High 3% credit card processing fees  
- Staff tied up answering phone calls  
- Low lunch hour traffic and no targeted deals for working-class customers


## Solution
- Centralized all third-party orders through **Slice POS**  
- Reduced processing fees from 3% to 2.4%  
- Enabled **Anderson AI Bot** to handle phone orders  
- Proposed **lunch menu combos** ($9.99–$13.99 with fries + drink)  
- Developed a **flyer campaign** targeting office workers in downtown

## My Role
- Analyzed inefficiencies in the original system  
- Researched cost-saving vendor alternatives  
- Managed and tested Slice POS implementation  
- Created the business case for AI call handling  
- Designed and priced lunch combos  
- Created go-to-market plan with print flyers

## Results 
- All orders now appear in a unified system  
- Employee workload has reduced  
- Lower operational costs (fees, printer, staffing)  
- Lunch strategy in testing phase — tracking sales impact weekly
